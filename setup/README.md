command for install typescript and create typescript environment
```
npm install -g typescript

tsc --version/ tsc -v
```
g(global)

also in some oither cases we have to create config file for ts to handle how it should behave othervise it will directly convert to js file but also tell us some errors in emd
```
tsc init
```

```
tsc or tsc file_name.ts
```
it will convert typescript code to javascript

```
node file_name.js
```
it will run js file
